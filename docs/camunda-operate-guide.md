## üö® Incident Management

### Common Incident Types

#### 1. Service Task Failures
**Symptoms**: Process stuck at service task (Publish Policy, Notify Stakeholders)
**Causes**:
- Database connection issues
- Email service unavailable
- File system permissions

**Resolution**:
```
1. Navigate to "Incidents" tab
2. Click on the failed instance
3. Review error message and stack trace
4. Fix underlying issue (restart service, fix permissions)
5. Click "Retry" to resume process
```

#### 2. User Task Assignment Issues
**Symptoms**: Tasks not appearing in task lists
**Causes**:
- Invalid assignee ID
- User not found in system
- Task list service down

**Resolution**:
```
1. Check process variables for correct assignee
2. Verify user exists in database
3. Restart task list service if needed
4. Manually reassign task if necessary
```

#### 3. DMN Evaluation Errors
**Symptoms**: Process fails at decision gateway
**Causes**:
- Invalid input data format
- Missing required variables
- DMN table logic errors

**Resolution**:
```
1. Review input variables for DMN evaluation
2. Check DMN table rules and conditions
3. Verify data types match expected format
4. Update process variables if needed
5. Retry the incident
```

### Incident Resolution Workflow
```
1. Identify Incident
   ‚Üì
2. Analyze Error Message
   ‚Üì
3. Check Process Variables
   ‚Üì
4. Fix Root Cause
   ‚Üì
5. Retry or Update Variables
   ‚Üì
6. Monitor Resolution
```
